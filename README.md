## Lab 18: Caesar Cipher
Monika Davies

### About

This project includes three cryptography methods:

encrypt() - takes plaintext and an integer key, and returns text encrypted with a Caesar Cipher shifted by the 
provided key.

decrypt() - takes plaintext and an integer key, and decrypts Caesar Cipher-encrypted text.

crack() - takes Caesar Cipher-encrypted text and uses a brute force technique to decode and return the decrypted text.
